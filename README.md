# website-labs
Test labs for experimenting with Website tech (VueJS and ReactJS)

# Lab basics
Each lab is meant to be a playground for experimenting with different ideas or things to remember and could be used as lookups.

The basics for each lab is using TailwindCss as a utility framework for styling. In most cases to make styling more flexable, using things like vuejs transitions is not done in order to use CSS transitions directly (even though semantically Vue provides ways of doing this already). The idea is to make things attempt be close to framework agnostic...

These labs do not cover writing tests as they are not full applications. In some scenarios, storybookjs is used to try UI documentation, etc.

This repo is a playground for experimentation.
