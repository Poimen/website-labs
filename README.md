# vuejs-labs
Test labs for experimenting with VueJS

# Lab basics
Each lab is meant to be a playground for experimenting with different ideas or things to remember and could be used as lookups.

The basics for each lab is:
1. Vue 3 CLI created environment
2. Using TailwindCss as a utility framework
3. Attempt not to use external non-vuejs javascript libraries
4. Learn...

These labs do not cover writing tests as they are not full applications. In some scenarios, storybookjs is used to try UI documentation, etc.

This repo is a playground for experimentation.
